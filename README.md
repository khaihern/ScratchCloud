# ScratchCloud

Introducing the next-generation method to interact with Scratch Cloud Data!

ScratchCloud is an extension to the cloud data/services offer on the Scratch website. This allows your Scratch projects to have a server outside of Scratch storing all your projects' data. Our user interface makes it easy to configure and sets up the logic of your cloud. In addition, ScratchCloud also comes with a wide set and evergrowing premade packages that allows developers to get weather data, sports data, etc into their Scratch projects!

Of course, all of these features needs to have some directions and guides. Therefore, we also offer detailed and beautiful documentations for each packages and configurations.
